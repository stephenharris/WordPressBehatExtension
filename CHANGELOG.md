# Change Log
This project is currently at an alpha stage. It will continue on the `0.*.*` branch until the first stable release.

## develop

### Enhancements:

- `Context\Util\Spin` trait now displays underlying exception message when it times out.
- Use "Pretty Print" json for email files to make them more human-friendly.
- Add config `overwrite_config` (accepts boolean value) to set whether the Behat extension should overwrite the `wp-config.php` file of the installation where Behat is being run. This is good for setups where either this is not useful or where it could be even harmful.
- Add `host` field for the Behat extension configuration, allowing usage of a MySQL server that runs on something else than `localhost`.

### Breaking changes:

- Fix bug in `Context\Util\Spin::fillField()` not calling parent method correctly. This trait can not be used in a `Context` but can be used in page/element objects
- `WordPress` context no longer extends `MinkContext`
- Mandatory `site_url` setting added, URL should point to the WordPress install

### Bugfixes:

- Fixes incorrect error message password used for logging in is incorrect [#11](https://github.com/stephenharris/WordPressBehatExtension/issues/11)

- The `Given there are posts` step expects the `post_author` column to the be username of the user, not the ID.
- Split out log-in related steps into their own context and introduce  `Login` and `Dashboard` page object
